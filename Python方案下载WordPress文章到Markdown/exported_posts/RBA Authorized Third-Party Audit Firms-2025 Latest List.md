title: RBA Authorized Third-Party Audit Firms-2025 Latest List
---

The Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Validated Assessment Program (VAP) is
the leading standard for social compliance verification in the global
electronics supply chain. RBA itself does not conduct assessments but sets the
standards and authorizes independent third-party firms specially trained in
the VAP protocol to perform these audits.

### How the RBA Audit System Works

The RBA audit system operates through a network of approved third-party
assessment firms that:

  * Conduct thorough onsite assessments lasting 2-5 days
  * Review documentation, interview management and employees, and perform visual site surveys
  * Use local, native-speaking assessors trained to identify violations including forced labor
  * Rate findings by severity (Priority, Major, or Minor)
  * Develop corrective action plans (CAPs) for remediation

### Audit Scope

RBA audits comprehensively evaluate:

  * **Labor Rights** : Working hours, wages, freedom of association, non-discrimination
  * **Health & Safety**: Workplace safety, emergency preparedness, industrial hygiene
  * **Environmental Protection** : Environmental permits, pollution prevention, resource conservation
  * **Business Ethics** : Anti-corruption, information disclosure, intellectual property protection
  * **Supply Chain Management** : Supplier responsibility, risk assessment, continuous improvement

### RBA audit 2025 Authorized Audit Firms
