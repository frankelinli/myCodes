国际劳工组织副总干事吉尔伯特·洪博在欧洲议会关于商业与人权的听证会上发表讲话，强调了监管和执法对于促进人权和工人权利的重要性。

***European Parliament Subcommittee on Human Rights – Hearing on business and respect for the human rights of workers (outside the EU), 24 September 2014\
欧洲议会人权小组委员会 – 关于商业和尊重工人人权的听证会（欧盟以外），2014 年 9 月 24 日****\&#xA;*

Madam Chair, 主席女士，

Distinguished Members of the European Parliament,\
尊敬的欧洲议会议员，

I would like to thank you for inviting the ILO to this important hearing on corporate social responsibility and workers’ rights – a very important topic indeed.\
我要感谢您邀请国际劳工组织参加这次关于企业社会责任和工人权利的重要听证会——这确实是一个非常重要的话题。

At the very outset, let me take this opportunity to congratulate the Members of Parliament on their recent election (or re-election) to this important assembly.\
首先，请允许我借此机会祝贺议会议员最近当选（或连任）进入这一重要议会。

In my intervention, I will first outline some of the key challenges for workers’ rights in a globalized economy and then mention the tools and instruments adopted by the ILO to deal with them.\
在我的发言中，我将首先概述全球化经济中工人权利面临的一些主要挑战，然后提及国际劳工组织为应对这些挑战而采取的工具和手段。

I will conclude by making some suggestions on how Members of Parliament could support the respect for workers’ rights in developing countries.\
最后，我将就议会议员如何支持尊重发展中国家工人的权利提出一些建议。

Today, there is growing awareness of the need for a fair globalization.\
今天，人们越来越意识到公平全球化的必要性。

The World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization, established by the ILO in 2003, highlighted ,in its report, that Multinational enterprises are important agents of change in the process of globalization.\
国际劳工组织2003年成立的全球化社会影响世界委员会在其报告中强调，跨国企业是全球化进程中变革的重要推动者。

They can stimulate economic growth in host countries and play a key role in cross-border transfers of capital, skills, know-how, resources and technology.\
它们可以刺激东道国的经济增长，并在资本、技能、知识、资源和技术的跨境转移中发挥关键作用。

In this context, ensuring respect for fundamental principles and rights at work results in undeniable benefits to the development of human potential and economic growth in general and therefore contributes to global economic recovery, social justice and sustainable peace.\
在此背景下，确保尊重工作中的基本原则和权利会给人类潜力的开发和总体经济增长带来不可否认的好处，从而有助于全球经济复苏、社会正义和可持续和平。

The ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and rights at Work of 1998 and the ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization of 2008 are mutually supportive and aim at giving a social dimension to globalisation and promoting respect for workers’ rights.\
1998 年《国际劳工组织关于工作中的基本原则和权利宣言》和 2008 年《国际劳工组织关于争取公平全球化的社会正义宣言》是相互支持的，旨在赋予全球化社会层面并促进对工人权利的尊重。

Unfortunately, attacks on human and trade union rights are on the rise as demonstrated by the increase in the number of cases examined by the Committee on Freedom of Association every year. Last year the Committee examined 100 cases.\
不幸的是，对人权和工会权利的攻击正在增加，结社自由委员会每年审查的案件数量不断增加就证明了这一点。去年，委员会审查了 100 起案件。

There are 168 million children still working in the world and 21 million victims of forced labour. Migrant workers’ rights are not respected and gender-equality is not yet fully realised.\
世界上仍有 1.68 亿儿童仍在工作，2100 万强迫劳动受害者。农民工权利没有得到尊重，性别平等尚未充分实现。

Last year the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory claimed the lives of more than 1,100 people – mostly women – This tragedy drew much public attention far beyond the borders of Bangladesh and the European Parliament itself adopted several resolutions related to it.\
去年，拉纳广场工厂的倒塌夺去了 1,100 多人的生命，其中大部分是女性。这场悲剧引起了远远超出孟加拉国边界的公众关注，欧洲议会本身也通过了多项相关决议。

Today, our economy is characterised by global competition and the rapid growth of extensive global supply chains.\
今天，我们经济的特点是全球竞争和广泛的全球供应链的快速增长。

As you all know, many of the products and goods we consume today are often produced and manufactured in different parts of the world and let me emphasize that global supply chains, operating across borders, have undoubtedly created much-needed jobs especially in least developed economies.\
众所周知，我们今天消费的许多产品和商品往往是在世界不同地区生产和制造的，让我强调，跨国经营的全球供应链无疑创造了急需的就业机会，特别是在最不发达经济体。

But at the same time, global supply chains raise important question marks about the quality of the jobs created and respect for workers’ fundamental rights.\
但与此同时，全球供应链对所创造的就业机会的质量和对工人基本权利的尊重提出了重要的质疑。

Very often, several work-related tragedies witnessed in recent past would have prevented if national and international standards had been applied. But the reality of supply chains is very complex.\
很多时候，如果应用国家和国际标准，最近发生的几起与工作有关的悲剧就可以避免。但供应链的现实情况非常复杂。

Naturally, working conditions and labour relations are regulated by national laws. Unfortunately in many low income countries (or middle income countries with weak institutional capacities) enforcement of national laws could be a serious challenges.\
当然，工作条件和劳动关系受国家法律管辖。不幸的是，在许多低收入国家（或机构能力薄弱的中等收入国家），国家法律的执行可能是一个严峻的挑战。

An added complication is that, some supply chains, notably the ready-made garments, are becoming extremely long with “sub” and “sub sub” contractors reaching down to very small enterprises.\
另一个复杂之处在于，一些供应链，特别是成衣，变得非常长，“分包”和“分包”承包商深入到非常小的企业。

But international retailers cannot ignore the working conditions being offered by their suppliers, at least by their main suppliers, as they usually tightly control the quality of the production, especially when it is sold under their brand.\
但国际零售商不能忽视其供应商（至少是其主要供应商）提供的工作条件，因为他们通常严格控制产品的质量，尤其是在以自己的品牌销售时。

The ILO’s response is to engage in innovative partnerships with the workers, employers and government of both the supplying and consuming countries.\
国际劳工组织的应对措施是与供应国和消费国的工人、雇主和政府建立创新伙伴关系。

Building on this, the ILO together with the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation has a joint programme called — Better Work.\
在此基础上，国际劳工组织与世界银行国际金融公司共同制定了一项名为“更好的工作”的联合计划。

It aims to improve both compliance with labour standards and competitiveness in global supply chains through country-based programmes in the garment sector.\
它旨在通过服装行业的国家计划来提高对劳工标准的遵守和全球供应链的竞争力。

I believe these sorts of creative partnerships do hold hope for working women and men in great need of improved labour protection.\
我相信这种创造性的伙伴关系确实为急需改善劳动保护的职业女性和男性带来了希望。

37 years ago, the ILO tripartite constituents adopted the Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy and is today more relevant than ever.\
37年前，国际劳工组织三方成员通过了《关于跨国企业和社会政策的三方原则宣言》，如今比以往任何时候都更加重要。

As an ILO instrument, the Declaration revolves around industrial relations, freedom of association and collective bargaining, dialogue and consultations as the key mechanism to achieve positive outcomes.\
作为国际劳工组织的一项文书，该宣言围绕劳资关系、结社自由和集体谈判、对话和协商作为实现积极成果的关键机制。

Making full use of the MNE Declaration is an excellent opportunity to promote workers’ rights in the global chains.\
充分利用《多国企业宣言》是促进全球连锁企业工人权利的绝佳机会。

Ultimately while solidarity, corporate social responsibility and technical assistance are important, true sustainable progress requires a clear and equitable regulatory environment, strong law enforcement and national institutions to enable social partners to do their part of the job\
最终，虽然团结、企业社会责任和技术援助很重要，但真正的可持续进步需要明确和公平的监管环境、强有力的执法和国家机构，以使社会伙伴能够履行自己的职责

Allow me to conclude with some suggestions for you, Members of the European Parliament, in your future work in this area:\
最后，请允许我对欧洲议会议员们今后在这一领域的工作提出一些建议：

- **Firstly, I think it is essential to continue raising awareness on this issue** both within the EU and in its external relations. I am sure several of you are already deeply involved in this and your efforts should be pursued.\
  **首先，我认为有必要继续提高欧盟内部及其对外关系中对此问题的认识**。我相信你们中的一些人已经深入参与其中，并且应该继续努力。
- **Secondly**, in your relations with other countries, or when involved in your human rights dialogues, you might feel the need to emphasize the importance of **putting national legislation in conformity with international labour standards** – particularly freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining which are essential for workers to be able to negotiate better working conditions both at the plant and national levels.\
  **其次**，在与其他国家的关系中，或者在参与人权对话时，您可能会觉得有必要强调**使国家立法符合国际劳工标准**的重要性，特别是结社自由和集体谈判权，这些标准是国际劳工标准的重要组成部分。对于工人能够在工厂和国家层面协商更好的工作条件至关重要。
- **Thirdly**, in many developing countries, law enforcement is weak. **Development cooperation should give higher visibility and priority to this problem**. International support can play a significant role to help strengthen the capacity of national authorities to better implement laws and regulations.\
  **第三**，许多发展中国家执法薄弱。**发展合作应高度重视这一问题并予以优先重视**。国际支持可以发挥重要作用，帮助加强国家当局更好地实施法律法规的能力。
- **Fourthly** you might wish to raise the issue of financial and technical assistance for the **effective implementation of the international standards** set forth in the sustainability chapters of the **free trade agreement that the EU signs with third countries**.\
  **第四，**&#x60A8;可能希望提出财政和技术援助的问题，以有效实施**欧盟与第三国签署的自由贸易协定**的可持续发展章节中规定**的国际标准**。
- **Lastly call on companies to adhere to internationally agreed standards** such as the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy (ILO MNE Declaration), the UN Global Compact or the OECD guidelines and encourage companies to use the free ILO helpdesk for business if they need advice on respecting international labour standards.\
  **最后呼吁企业遵守国际商定的标准，**&#x4F8B;如国际劳工组织关于跨国企业和社会政策的三方原则宣言（国际劳工组织多国企业宣言）、联合国全球契约或经合组织指南，并鼓励企业在以下情况下使用免费的国际劳工组织服务台：他们需要有关尊重国际劳工标准的建议。

It has been widely recognised that in a global market economy, there ought to be rules that embrace everyone and a mechanism for dialogue, common solutions and follow up.\
人们普遍认识到，在全球市场经济中，应该有包容各方的规则，应该有对话、共同解决和后续行动的机制。

After all, being “socially responsible” should not become a distraction from the real issue—obeying and enforcing the law and respecting principles. Corporate Social Responsibility is complementary and not a substitute to international labour standards.\
毕竟，“社会责任”不应该分散人们对真正问题的注意力——遵守和执行法律以及尊重原则。企业社会责任是国际劳工标准的补充，而不是替代。

I wish you a lot of success in your new legislature and thank you very much for your attention.\
我祝愿您在新的立法机构中取得巨大成功，并非常感谢您的关注。
